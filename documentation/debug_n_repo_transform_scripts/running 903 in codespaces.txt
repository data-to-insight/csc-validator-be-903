Running 903 on codespaces

Load up a codespace on 903
Ensure docker is installed,
ctrl+shift+p rebuild container
in the terminal poetry install
then poetry shell (starts poetry virtual environment)
You should now have access to the CLI

to run tests (not on rules): poetry run coverage run --data-file='.coverage.framework' -m pytest

NOTE gitignore includes xlsx so any excel files you use in codespaces will NOT be pushed to github
